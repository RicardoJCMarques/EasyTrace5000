## Safety & Material Guide

**Please read this before machining your first board.**

### PCB Substrate Selection (FR4 vs FR1)
* **Avoid FR4 for home milling:** Standard FR4 PCB stock is made of **fiberglass-reinforced epoxy**. Milling into FR4 creates fine glass dust. This dust is:
    * **Hazardous to health:** Glass particulates can cause serious respiratory issues (silicosis) when inhaled and skin irritation.
    * **Bad for machinery:** Glass dust is highly abrasive and will wear out linear bearings, lead screws, and spindle runout very quickly.
    * **Hard on tools:** It will dull standard carbide endmills much faster.

* **Use FR1 (Phenolic Paper):** For prototyping isolation routing, **FR1** (also sold as Bakelite or Phenolic Paper) is strongly recommended. 
    * It contains **no fiberglass**.
    * Making the dust less abrasive (though you still need to be somewhat careful).
    * It's easier to work with, meaning less machine and tool wear.

### Dust & Fume Extraction
* **CNC:** Always use a vacuum system or enclosure with FR4. Even FR1 dust should not be inhaled. Good feeds and speeds also help make dust less fine and easier to contain.
* **Laser:** Fiber laser processing burns the epoxy/phenolic resins, releasing **toxic fumes** (including carbon monoxide and various carcinogens). **Active ventilation to the outdoors or filtering is mandatory.**

Note: Jury's still out on UV lasers but until proven otherwise, use them with the same caution as fiber lasers.

## Key Features

* **Multi-Operation Workflow**
   A non-destructive workflow for common PCB CAM tasks:
   * **Isolation Routing:** Multi-pass trace isolation with external offsets.
   * **Drilling:** Smart peck-or-mill strategy selection with slot support.
   * **Copper Clearing:** Internal pocketing for large copper areas.
   * **Board Cutouts:** Path generation with optional tab placement.

* **1. Advanced Geometry Engine**
   The first stage converts source files into offset *geometry*.
   * **Analytic Parsing:** Reads Gerber, Excellon and full SVG paths (including arcs and Béziers) and converts to geometry objects.
   * **Board Rotation/Mirroring:** Support for project rotation and horizontal/vertical mirroring. (No per object manipulation, yet)
   * **Clipper2 Engine:** Uses the WebAssembly compilation of Clipper2 for high-performance boolean operations.
   * **Arc Reconstruction:** Reconstructs true arcs (G2/G3) from polygonized post-Clipper2 data.
   * **Unified Offset Pipeline:** A single pipeline handles both external (isolation) and internal (clearing) multi-pass offsets.
   * **Smart Drill Strategy:** Analyzes drill hole/slot size against tool diameter and generates the required operational object.

* **2. Intelligent Toolpath Pipeline**
   The final export stage converts geometry into optimized machine motion.
   * **Geometry Translation:** Translates geometry objects and their metadata into organized toolpath plans with proper entry/exit points.
   * **Toolpath Optimization:** Optionally restructures the toolpath plan to maximize efficiency:
      * **Staydown Clustering:** Geometrically analyzes paths and groups nearby cuts to minimize Z-axis retractions.
      * **Path Ordering:** Applies a nearest-neighbor algorithm to sort clusters and reduce rapid travel time.
      * **Segment Simplification:** Removes collinear points with angle-aware tolerance.
   * **Machine Processing:** Injects all necessary machine-specific commands:
      * Adds rapids, plunges, and retracts to safe/travel Z-heights.
      * Detects multi-depth passes on the same path to perform quick Z-plunges without retract.
      * Manages complex hole/slot entries (helix or plunge).
      * Handles Z-lifts for board tabs during cutout operations.

* **3. Multi-Stage Canvas Renderer**
   * **Render optimization:** Provides smooth panning and zooming with batching, level of detail and viewport culling.
   * **Multi-Stage Visualization:** Clearly and distinctly renders **Source** (Gerber/SVG), **Offset** (generated paths), and **Preview** (tool-reach simulation) layers. Plus optional Debug features.
   * **Smart Drill Rendering:** Visually distinguishes source drill holes/slots, offset-stage peck marks, and final preview simulations with color-coded warnings for tool relation (exact/undersized/oversized).

# Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
* **Geometry Engine:** [Clipper2](https://github.com/AngusJohnson/Clipper2) via [WebAssembly](https://github.com/ErikSom/Clipper2-WASM/)
* **Rendering:** Custom 2D Canvas-based layer renderer with an overlay system for grids, rulers, and origin points.
* **File Parsing:** Native parsers for Gerber (RS-274X), Excellon and SVG formats.
* **Toolpath Generation:** A three-stage pipeline (Translate, Optimize, Process) to convert geometry into machine-ready plans.
* **Post-Processors:** GRBL, GrblHAL (Experimental), Marlin (Experimental), LinuxCNC (Experimental), Mach3 (Experimental), Roland RML (VERY Experimental).

Note: All Experimental post-processors need testing. I only have access to GRBL and Roland machines, be extra cautious. Please report successes or issues so I know and can plan accordingly.

## File Compatibility

The application has been developed and tested with files generated from **KiCAD** and **EasyEDA**.

* **Gerber:** `.gbr`, `.ger`, `.gtl`, `.gbl`, `.gts`, `.gbs`, `.gko`, `.gm1`
* **Excellon:** `.drl`, `.xln`, `.txt`, `.drill`, `.exc`
* **SVG**

Note: The parser understands all SVG data including complex Bézier curves and creates the corresponding Cubic or Quadratic primitives. Bézier primitives are then interpolated by the plotter into line segments, as the geometry engine does not support analytic Bézier offsetting, yet.

## Usage

### Quick Start
1. **Load Files:** From the Quickstart screen, Drag-and-drop over the preview canvas or use "Add Files" button for each operation type
2. **Origin & Machine Settings:** Check origin and overall machine parameters for the project
3. **Select File:** Select a source file object from the Operation Navigation tree to expose related parameters
4. **Generate Offsets:** Set X&Y axis parameters: passes, stepover and click "Generate Offsets"
5. **Preview Toolpath:** Define Z axis parameters: cut depth, multi-pass, entry-type and click "Generate Preview"
6. **Export G-code:** Open Operations Manager, arrange sequence, confirm gcode parameters, preview & export

## The Workflow

The application guides the user through a clear, non-destructive process. Each stage builds on the last, and its visibility can be toggled in the renderer.

### Stage 1: Source (Load Geometry)
* **Action:** Add Gerber, Excellon or SVG files to the respective operation.
* **Result:** The original source geometry is parsed, analyzed and displayed in the renderer.
* **You See:** The original trace paths, pads, regions, drill holes and slots.

### Stage 1.5: Board Placement and Machine settings
* **Action:** Double check origin, rotation/mirroring and base Machine parameters.
* **Result:** Sets origin, transforms geometry and all machine settings that will affect toolpaths.
* **You See:** Origin/rulers will adapt if origin is moved and board geometry will re-align if rotated or mirrored.

### Stage 2: Offset (Generate Geometry)
* **Action:** Configure parameters (tool, depth, stepover) and click **"Generate Offsets"**.
* **Result:** The core triggers the **Geometry Engine**.
   * For **Milling** operations, this creates new `offset` primitives using virtually lossless pipelines.
   * For **Drilling** operations, this runs the drill strategy logic, creating Peck, Drill Milling, or Centerline primitives based on tool/hole size comparison.
* **You See:** New objects appear in the tree ("Pass 1", "Peck Marks", "Milling Paths") and are rendered as thin red outlines. Drill markings are color-coded: green (exact fit), yellow (undersized tool), red (oversized tool).

### Stage 3: Preview (Simulate Tool Reach)
* **Action:** Configure parameters (feed rate, plunge rate, spindle rpms) and click **Generate Preview**.
* **Result:** This is a lightweight, *visual-aid* step. It creates `preview` primitives using the `offset` objects but stroked with the tool's diameter.
* **You See:** New objects in the tree that render as simulated toolpaths the width of the tool, showing you what material will be removed. (Automatically hides offset geometry objects)

### Stage 4: Gcode Export
* **Action:** Click **Operations & G-Code**, check operation order and export options. Click Calculate Toolpaths and then either copy g-code from the text box or Export as a file.
* **Result:** Calculating Toolpaths translates the geometry objects into toolpath plan objects, optionally optimizes them and converts them to final machine ready code.
* **You See:** G-Code Preview text box will become populated by the g-code and clicking **Export G-Code** will create a file for the browser to save/download.

## Running Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RicardoJCMarques/Eltryus_CAM.git
   ```

2. No build step required - pure client-side application

3. Recommended: Use VS Code with [Five Server](https://github.com/yandeu/five-server-vscode) extension
   - Right-click `index.html` → "Open with Five Server"
   - Browser should open at `http://127.0.0.1:5500/`

4. Optional: Create `fiveserver.config.js` for custom server configuration

## Testing & Debugging

```javascript
// Browser console commands
window.enablePCBDebug()                 // Enable verbose logging - Toggle in Visualization options too
window.pcbcam.getStats()                // Display pipeline statistics
window.getReconstructionRegistry()      // Inspect arc metadata from curve registry
```

## Known Issues & Limitations

**Current Limitations:**
* **Post-Processors:** Consider all non-grbl post-processors as experimental and to be used with caution until further notice.
* **Metric Units:** Millimeters only. System is technically unit agnostic but base 10. A unit conversion module is planned.
* **Bézier Offsetting:** While Bézier curves from SVGs are parsed analytically, they are interpolated (converted to line segments) by the plotter. True analytic offsetting and booleans of Béziers is not yet supported.
* **Tool Changes:** The application does not currently generate tool change commands (M6). Operations using different tools must be exported as separate G-code files.
* **UI:** Small screen/mobile support is incomplete.

**Known Bugs:**
* **Offsetting of corners:** Depending on distance between an internal corner (concave) and external corner (convex) the analytic offsetting engine may cause artifacts between the external rounded joint's arc and the internal side path.

## Roadmap

- Unit conversion system
- Responsive design for smaller screens
- Tool library import/export
- Theme import/export
- Multi-lingual UI
- Laser compatible files (isolation, soldermasks, etc)
- Automatic tool change (M6) support
- Improved toolpath optimization
- 3D G-code preview/simulation
- Multi-sided PCB support
- Service Worker for offline caching

## Development Tools

### Clipper2 Integration Test Suite
The repository includes a standalone test page used during initial development to test syntax of the WASM compilation factory wrapper. It's living documentation on how to interact with the Clipper2 WASM library.

* **Live website:** [cam.eltryus.design/clipper2/](https://cam.eltryus.design/clipper2/)
* **Purpose:** Interactive sandbox for Boolean operations, Offsetting, Minkowski Sums, and Arc Reconstruction.
* **Self-served:** Navigate to `http://localhost:YOUR_PORT/clipper2/` while serving the project.
