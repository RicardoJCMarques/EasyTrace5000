# Multi-Sensor LED Control Board

This is a small open hardware board designed for learning, experimenting, and building.

It controls five LEDs and includes:
- A radial potentiometer
- An LM35 temperature sensor
- An LDR (light-dependent resistor)

Inputs are placed on the left, outputs on the right, making the board intuitive and easy to understand—especially for educational use.

Use it for:
- Learning basic electronics
- Teaching sensors and outputs
- Prototyping ideas
- Playing, breaking, and rebuilding things
