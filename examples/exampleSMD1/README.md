# SMD Example Board (Placeholder)

This example project was selected as it required all operations and had letters formed with traces.

## Why this board?
It's mostly a remnant from the development of the geometry system as it includes a lot of complex geometry.
* **Usage:** Use this to test the workflow for all operations and understand what to expect.

### Status
**This is currently a placeholder.** It'll be replaced with something more useful in the near future.
