## Keyboard Navigation Overview

The interface is designed for full keyboard operability using a **Focus Zone** strategy. This reduces repetitive tabbing by allowing users to jump between major workspace areas.

### Global Navigation

These shortcuts work globally to navigate the application structure.

| Key | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `F6` | Cycle focus forward through zones: **Toolbar** → **Operations Tree** → **Canvas** → **Properties Panel** |
| `Shift` + `F6` | Cycle focus backward through zones |
| `Tab` | Move focus to the next interactive element within the current zone |
| `Shift` + `Tab` | Move focus to the previous interactive element |
| `F1` | Open the Help & Shortcuts modal |

> **Note:** A **Skip Link** is available on the first `Tab` press after page load to jump directly to the Canvas.

---

## Zone-Specific Controls

Each zone has specific interactions once it receives focus.

### Toolbar & Sidebar Headers

| Key | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Tab` / `Shift` + `Tab` | Navigate between buttons and menu items |
| `←` / `→` | Navigate horizontally between toolbar buttons |
| `Enter` / `Space` | Activate the focused button or toggle a dropdown |
| `Escape` | Close an open dropdown menu |

### Operations Tree (Left Sidebar)

The tree uses a **roving tabindex** pattern. Press `Tab` to enter the tree list, then use arrow keys to navigate.

| Key | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `↑` / `↓` | Move focus to the previous or next visible item |
| `→` | Expand a category/file, or move focus to the first child |
| `←` | Collapse a category/file, or move focus to the parent |
| `Home` / `End` | Jump to the first or last item in the tree |
| `Enter` / `Space` | Select the item (opens properties) or toggle category expansion |
| `Delete` | Remove the selected file or geometry layer |
| `V` | Toggle visibility of the selected layer |

### Canvas Controls

These controls are active when the **Canvas** zone has focus.

**View Manipulation**

| Key | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `↑` / `↓` / `←` / `→` | Pan the view |
| `Shift` + `Arrow` | Pan faster |
| `+` / `-` | Zoom in / Zoom out |
| `Home` / `F` / `=` | Fit all geometry to view |

**Display & Tools**

| Key | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `W` | Toggle Wireframe mode |
| `G` | Toggle Grid visibility |
| `B` | Set Origin to Bottom-Left (Preview) |
| `C` | Set Origin to Center (Preview) |
| `O` | Save/Confirm current origin position |

### Property Panel (Right Sidebar)

This panel handles parameter inputs for selected operations.

| Key | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Tab` | Move to next field, button, or help icon |
| `Shift` + `Tab` | Move to previous field |
| `↓` / `↑` | Navigate focus between property rows (Grid Navigation) |
| `Enter` | Enter "Edit Mode" on a focused row |
| `Enter` *(while editing)* | Commit change and move to next field |
| `Escape` | Cancel edit/tooltip and return focus to the row |

---

## Modals & Dialogs

When a modal (e.g., **G-code Export**) is open, focus is trapped within it until closed. Global navigation keys (`F6`) are disabled.

### General Navigation

| Key | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Tab` | Cycle forward through inputs and buttons |
| `Shift` + `Tab` | Cycle backward through inputs and buttons |
| `Escape` | Close the modal or cancel the current action |

### Sortable Lists (G-code Export)

For reordering operations in the export list:

| Key | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Space` | **Grab** the focused item for reordering |
| `↑` / `↓` | Move the grabbed item up or down the list |
| `Space` | **Drop** the item in its new position |
| `Escape` | Cancel the grab action and reset position |

## Screen Reader Support

### Live Regions

- **Status bar**: Uses `aria-live="polite"` for general updates, `aria-live="assertive"` for errors
- Status messages announce file loading, operation completion, and errors

### Semantic Structure

- Main landmarks: `<header>` (toolbar), `<main>` (canvas), `<aside>` (sidebars), `<footer>` (status bar)
- Headings hierarchy maintained within sections
- Form labels associated with inputs via `for`/`id`

### Button Labels

All icon-only buttons include `aria-label` attributes describing their function:
- "Fit to View", "Zoom In", "Zoom Out"
- "Toggle Visibility", "Delete", etc.

### SVG Icons

Decorative icons include `aria-hidden="true"` to prevent screen reader noise.

## WCAG 2.1 Compliance

EasyTrace5000 targets **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** compliance. While the application is fully functional for keyboard users, some visual aspects (such as complex canvas geometry) have inherent limitations.

### Implemented Guidelines

| Guideline | Description | Status | Implementation Notes |
|-----------|-------------|--------|----------------------|
| **1.1.1** | Non-text Content | ✓ | Icon-only buttons include `aria-label` attributes; decorative icons use `aria-hidden="true"`. |
| **1.3.1** | Info and Relationships | ✓ | Semantic HTML5 landmarks (`<main>`, `<aside>`, `<nav>`) and proper ARIA tree roles for the Operations panel. |
| **1.3.2** | Meaningful Sequence | ✓ | DOM order matches the visual layout; focus order flows logically through sidebars and canvas. |
| **1.4.1** | Use of Color | ✓ | Status messages (Success/Error) use both text labels and color indicators. |
| **1.4.3** | Contrast (Minimum) | ✓ | Default text-to-background contrast ratios meet the 4.5:1 standard. |
| **1.4.13**| Content on Hover/Focus| ✓ | Custom `TooltipManager` ensures tooltips are persistent on focus, hoverable, and do not obscure active content. |
| **2.1.1** | Keyboard | ✓ | All interactive elements (buttons, inputs, tree nodes, canvas) are keyboard accessible. |
| **2.1.2** | No Keyboard Trap | ✓ | Modal dialogs trap focus intentionally while open but release it correctly upon closing. |
| **2.1.4** | Character Key Shortcuts| ✓ | Single-key shortcuts (e.g., `V` for visibility, `Del` for delete) are scoped to the active region (Tree/Canvas) and disabled during text entry. |
| **2.4.1** | Bypass Blocks | ✓ | A "Skip to Canvas" link appears on the first Tab press. |
| **2.4.3** | Focus Order | ✓ | Modals and panels manage focus logically; closing a modal returns focus to the triggering element. |
| **2.4.6** | Headings and Labels | ✓ | Descriptive headings identify all major workspace sections; inputs have associated `<label>` elements. |
| **2.4.7** | Focus Visible | ✓ | High-contrast CSS focus rings (`:focus-visible`) appear on all interactive elements. |
| **2.5.3** | Label in Name | ✓ | Accessible names for icon buttons match their visual tooltips (e.g., "Fit to View"). |
| **3.2.1** | On Focus | ✓ | Focusing on input fields or tree items never triggers a context change (submit/navigation). |
| **3.2.2** | On Input | ✓ | Parameter changes update the preview or require explicit confirmation; no unexpected page reloads. |
| **4.1.2** | Name, Role, Value | ✓ | Custom controls (Tree View, Toggles) use correct ARIA roles (`tree`, `treeitem`, `button`). |
| **4.1.3** | Status Messages | ✓ | Dynamic updates (file loading, success messages) are announced via `aria-live` regions. |

### Partial or Planned Support

| Guideline | Description | Status | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| **1.4.11**| Non-text Contrast | Partial | Some UI borders and disabled states in the default theme may fall below 3:1. High Contrast themes are supported by the engine and are currently in development. |
| **1.2.x** | Time-based Media | N/A | The application does not contain audio or video content. |

## Known Limitations

1. **Canvas interaction**: The 2D canvas preview is visual-only. Geometry data is available via the operations tree, but spatial relationships require visual inspection.

2. **Complex geometry feedback**: When generating offsets or previews, detailed geometric results are shown visually but not fully announced to screen readers beyond success/failure status.

3. **Drag-and-drop file upload**: Requires mouse. Alternative: Click drop zones or use the file input buttons in the operations tree.

4. **Touch devices**: Touch zoom/pan works but keyboard navigation is primary accessibility path.

5. **Color-coded warnings**: Drill operation warnings use color coding (green/yellow/red). Status messages provide text descriptions.
